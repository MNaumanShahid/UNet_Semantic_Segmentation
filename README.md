# UNet_Semantic_Segmentation

Semantic Segmentation of Carvana Dataset using U-Net Architecture
This project implements a U-Net model for semantic segmentation of car masks in the Carvana Image Masking Challenge dataset.

Project Summary
The model achieves a high level of accuracy in segmenting car masks from images. Here are the key metrics:

Accuracy: 99.52% (87533868/87955200)
Dice Score: 0.9887
Model Architecture
The project utilizes the U-Net architecture, a popular convolutional neural network (CNN) for image segmentation tasks. The U-Net design incorporates contracting and expanding paths to capture both spatial and contextual information from the input images.

Dataset
The Carvana Image Masking Challenge dataset from Kaggle is used for training and validation. This dataset consists of a large collection of images with corresponding pixel-wise annotations for car masks.

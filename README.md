# UNet_Semantic_Segmentation

## Semantic Segmentation using UNet Architecture on Carvana Dataset
### This project aims to perform semantic segmentation on the Carvana dataset using the UNet architecture. Semantic segmentation is the task of classifying each pixel in an image into a particular class, enabling precise object detection and localization.

 ### Metrics

### About the Dataset
The Carvana dataset consists of high-resolution images of cars and corresponding pixel-level masks indicating the car pixels. This dataset is widely used for training and evaluating semantic segmentation models in the context of automotive image analysis.
